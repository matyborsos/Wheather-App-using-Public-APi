# Wheather-App-using-Public-APi


## Description 
This project was created as a capstone projectduring The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp. It's a fully functional web app that gives users real-time wheather infotmation about any city using a public API.

In this project, I built a website using the Express/Node.js platform, with the Axios HTTP client, that integrates a chosen public API. The website should interact with the chosen API, retrieve data, and present it in a user-friendly manner.

## Objectives
Develop an understanding of how to integrate public APIs into web projects.

Gain practical experience using Express/Node.js for server-side programming.

Enhance understanding of client-server communication using Axios.

Demonstrate ability to manipulate, present, and work with data retrieved from APIs.

Use a Ninja API for geocoding and the OpenWeatherMap API to build a website that tells a user wheather caracteristics about a certain city.


## Resources
Express.js, Node.js, Axios and Public APIs
